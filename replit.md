#### Multi-Tenant System
- **Organization Management**: Complete isolation between tenants.
- **Role-Based Access**: Super Admin, Org Admin, Manager, Team Lead, Recruiter with hierarchical access controls for AI matches and candidate visibility.
- **User Management**: Invitation system with temporary passwords.

#### Voice Calling System
- **Twilio Integration**: Automated outbound calling with an AI assistant ("Sarah").
- **Real-time Processing**: WebSocket-based audio streaming.
- **Transcript Generation**: Automatic call recording and analysis.

#### Document Processing
- **Multi-format Support**: PDF, DOCX, images via OpenAI Vision.
- **Cost Optimization**: Native processing without external Python dependencies.
- **Resume Preprocessing**: Local extraction before AI analysis.

#### ATS Pipeline Management
- Comprehensive ATS lifecycle management with Job Pipeline and Application Pipeline.
- Drag-and-drop workflow stages with real-time statistics updates.
- UI/UX improvements for navigation and card layouts.

#### Customizable Reporting System
- UI-first reporting system with drag-drop interface and visual analytics.
- Supports 3 chart types with multiple variants and real-time previews.
- Template management system with pre-built recruitment report templates.

#### Job Assignment System
- Granular role-based permissions (owner, assigned, viewer).
- Backend API endpoints for assignment management and secure validation.

#### Data Protection System
- **Object Storage Integration**: Complete database persistence using Replit Object Storage for deployments.
- **Automatic Cloud Backups**: Real-time backup creation to Object Storage after critical operations (job creation, candidate addition, user creation).
- **Manual Database Backup**: User-accessible backup button in Recruitment â†’ Overview for on-demand backups.
- **Smart Restoration**: Automatic database restoration from Object Storage when missing in production deployments.
- **Deployment Persistence**: Solves the critical data loss issue where Replit deployments reset filesystem between updates.
- **Production Environment Protection**: Enhanced data persistence manager with cloud-based backup storage.
- **Build Compatibility**: Fixed dynamic require() statements for proper ES module bundling in production deployments.
- **Critical Backup Timing Fix**: Resolved data loss issue where initialization backups were overwriting user data during deployment restarts.
- **CRITICAL FIX (Aug 2025)**: Modified restoreLatestBackup() to use Google Cloud Storage metadata timestamps instead of filename sorting, ensuring manually triggered backups are prioritized over older production-backup.db files.
- **Throttling Disabled**: Removed time throttling restrictions to ensure critical backups aren't skipped during rapid operations.
- **Dual Seeding Eliminated**: Consolidated all seeding logic to sqlite-db.ts, removing competing seeding systems that could overwrite restored data and create duplicate super admin accounts.
- **Database I/O Error Recovery System (Aug 2025)**: Implemented comprehensive SQLite corruption detection and recovery with automatic connection health checks, integrity verification, and retry mechanisms to prevent disk I/O errors in production deployments.
- **Connection Type Consistency Fix (Aug 2025)**: Resolved "select(...).limit is not a function" errors by standardizing initializeSQLiteDatabase() return types and adding I/O error recovery with automatic database restoration for production resilience.
- **Enhanced Authentication Resilience**: Added retry logic and connection reset capabilities to authentication middleware, ensuring robust token validation even during database connection issues.
- **Deployment Static File Fix (Aug 2025)**: Resolved critical deployment issue where Management view failed to load in production environment due to missing static build files. Created automated build process that correctly places React build artifacts in server/public directory, enabling proper static file serving in deployment.
