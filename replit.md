  - Changed from cryptic CallSID_StreamSID format to readable timestamp format
  - New format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS_CandidateName_CallSID.txt`
  - Example: `2025-07-15T08-39-40_Sarah_Johnson_fb802191.txt`
  - Enhanced transcript headers with candidate name, job position, and readable timestamps
  - Improved file organization for better user experience and file management
  - Files now clearly identify which candidate and job position the call was for
- July 15, 2025. **Switched from ngrok to Pinggy tunnel service with auto-refresh**

  - Implemented automatic tunnel refresh every 50 minutes (before 60-minute expiry)
  - Added dynamic domain resolution for each AI call to handle tunnel refreshes
  - Unified domain handling - removed separate dev/prod domain logic
  - Added SSH-based tunnel establishment with proper domain extraction
  - Enabled unlimited bandwidth and better stability for AI calling
