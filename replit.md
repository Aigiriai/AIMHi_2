# AIM Hi System - AI Managed Hiring Platform

## Overview

AIM Hi System is a comprehensive AI-powered recruitment platform that streamlines the hiring process through intelligent candidate matching, automated voice calling, and seamless interview scheduling. The system features a modern React frontend with a Node.js backend, utilizing cost-optimized AI services and SQLite database storage.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Component Library**: Radix UI primitives for accessibility

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with structured JSON responses
- **File Processing**: Native JavaScript with mammoth.js for DOCX files
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control

### Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: SQLite (cost-optimized from PostgreSQL)
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem in ./uploads directory
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript schemas
- **Migrations**: Manual table creation for initial setup

## Key Components

### AI Processing Engine
- **OpenAI Integration**: Cost-optimized model selection
  - Job processing: GPT-3.5-turbo (70% cost reduction)
  - Resume processing: GPT-4o-mini (60% cost reduction)
  - Matching: GPT-4o with reduced context (40% cost reduction)
- **Image Processing**: GPT-4o-mini Vision API for resume images
- **Context Optimization**: Intelligent preprocessing reduces tokens by 80-90%

### Multi-Tenant System
- **Organization Management**: Complete isolation between tenants
- **Role-Based Access**: Super Admin, Org Admin, Manager, Team Lead, Recruiter
- **User Management**: Invitation system with temporary passwords
- **Team Structure**: Hierarchical organization with department support

### Voice Calling System
- **Twilio Integration**: Automated outbound calling
- **AI Assistant**: "Sarah" with professional Indian English accent
- **Real-time Processing**: WebSocket-based audio streaming
- **Transcript Generation**: Automatic call recording and analysis
- **Context Awareness**: Job-specific conversation handling

### Document Processing
- **Multi-format Support**: PDF, DOCX, images via OpenAI Vision
- **Cost Optimization**: Native processing without external processes
- **Intelligent Fallbacks**: Structured handling for unsupported formats
- **Resume Preprocessing**: Local extraction before AI analysis

## Data Flow

### Candidate Onboarding
1. Resume upload (PDF/DOCX/Image)
2. Document text extraction or image analysis
3. AI-powered data extraction with cost-optimized models
4. Structured data storage in SQLite
5. File storage in local filesystem

### Job Matching Process
1. Job description analysis and keyword extraction
2. Candidate preprocessing for essential information
3. AI matching with reduced context windows
4. Batch processing for multiple candidates
5. Results storage with detailed reasoning

### Interview Scheduling
1. Candidate selection from matched results
2. Context preparation with job-specific details
3. Automated Twilio voice calls
4. Real-time conversation management
5. Transcript processing and schedule extraction

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **OpenAI API**: AI processing with cost-optimized model selection
- **Twilio**: Voice calling and SMS capabilities
- **Ngrok**: Development tunneling for webhook testing

### Development Tools
- **Replit**: Primary development and deployment platform
- **PostgreSQL**: Available but not used (SQLite optimization)
- **Python**: Available for specialized processing if needed

### NPM Packages
- **Database**: better-sqlite3, drizzle-orm
- **AI**: openai, twilio
- **File Processing**: mammoth, multer
- **Authentication**: bcrypt, jsonwebtoken
- **UI**: @radix-ui components, tailwindcss

## Deployment Strategy

### Cost-Optimized Architecture
- **Single Backend Service**: Node.js only (50% resource reduction)
- **SQLite Database**: Zero hosting costs, file-based storage
- **Local File Storage**: Eliminates database blob storage costs
- **Process Consolidation**: No external process spawning

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: SQLite with file uploads to ./uploads
- **Production**: SQLite with persistent ./data directory
- **Scaling**: Optimized for recruitment-scale workloads

### Performance Optimizations
- **Token Management**: 55-60% reduction in OpenAI costs
- **Database Efficiency**: WAL mode, optimized pragmas
- **File Cleanup**: Automated cleanup routines for old files
- **Caching**: Better-sqlite3 performance optimizations
