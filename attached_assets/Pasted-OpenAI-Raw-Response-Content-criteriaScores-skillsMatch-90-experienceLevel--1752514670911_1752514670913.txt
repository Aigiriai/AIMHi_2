  "detailedReasoning": "Akash Murme has a strong alignment with the required skills for the Hogan Developer position, particularly in COBOL, JCL, DB2, VSAM, and Hogan modules. His 6 years of experience is appropriate for a mid-level role, and he is currently employed in a relevant position, which enhances his recency score. He demonstrates a solid understanding of banking systems, particularly in loans and deposits, which aligns well with the job requirements. However, while he has experience with Hogan, the specific mention of ODS (Online Delivery Systems) is absent, which slightly affects his overall score.",
