# Comprehensive Table Expansion for Report Builder

## Overview
The Report generation feature has been significantly expanded from the original 3 tables to a comprehensive set of **10 tables** covering all major aspects of the recruitment system.

## Why Only Limited Tables Initially?

The initial implementation only included 3 tables (`jobs`, `candidates`, `interviews`) because:
1. **MVP Approach**: Started with core recruitment entities
2. **Development Priority**: Focused on basic reporting functionality first
3. **Schema Discovery**: Limited awareness of full database schema capabilities
4. **User Feedback**: Waited for user requirements to guide expansion

## Database Schema Analysis

### Available Tables in System (21+ total):
- ✅ **Core Data**: jobs, candidates, interviews, applications, job_matches
- ✅ **User Management**: users, teams, user_teams
- ✅ **Permissions**: job_assignments, candidate_assignments
- ✅ **Analytics**: status_history, usage_metrics, audit_logs
- ❌ **Meta Tables**: organizations, job_templates, candidate_submissions
- ❌ **Integrations**: organization_credentials, user_credentials
- ❌ **Report Engine**: report_table_metadata, report_field_metadata, report_templates
