# OpenAI Cost Optimization Implementation

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Removed AI-Based Document Classification
- **Before**: Used GPT-4o to classify documents as job descriptions or resumes (~$0.0025 per document)
- **After**: User responsibility to upload to correct endpoints, keyword-based fallback detection
- **Savings**: ~100% reduction in classification costs

### 2. Model Downgrading for Data Extraction

#### Job Description Processing
- **Before**: GPT-4o for job detail extraction (~$0.010-0.025 per job)
- **After**: GPT-3.5-turbo with 1500 character limit and 800 max tokens
- **Savings**: ~70% cost reduction

#### Resume Processing
- **Before**: GPT-4o for resume detail extraction (~$0.015-0.030 per resume)
- **After**: GPT-4o-mini with 2000 character limit and 1000 max tokens
- **Savings**: ~60% cost reduction

#### Image Resume Processing
- **Before**: GPT-4o Vision API (~$0.020-0.040 per image)
- **After**: GPT-4o-mini Vision API with 800 max tokens
- **Savings**: ~50% cost reduction

### 3. AI Matching Algorithm Optimization
- **Before**: Full job description and resume content sent to GPT-4o
- **After**: Truncated content (1500 chars resume, 1000 chars job) with 1200 max tokens
- **Model**: Kept GPT-4o for complex matching analysis but reduced input size
- **Savings**: ~40% cost reduction

## Cost Impact Analysis

### Per Document Processing Costs (Estimated)
| Operation | Before | After | Savings |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Document Classification | $0.0025 | $0.0000 | 100% |
| Job Description Extraction | $0.018 | $0.005 | 72% |
| Resume Extraction | $0.023 | $0.009 | 61% |
| Image Resume Processing | $0.030 | $0.015 | 50% |
| AI Matching per Candidate | $0.038 | $0.023 | 39% |

### Overall Expected Savings
- **Document Processing**: ~65% reduction
- **Matching Operations**: ~40% reduction
- **Total System-wide**: ~55-60% OpenAI cost reduction

## Implementation Details

### Context Window Reductions
- Job descriptions: Limited to 1500 characters
- Resume content: Limited to 2000 characters
- Token limits added to all API calls
- Focused on essential information extraction

### Model Selection Strategy
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: Simple extraction tasks (job details)
- **GPT-4o-mini**: Medium complexity tasks (resume extraction, image processing)
- **GPT-4o**: Complex analysis only (candidate matching)

### User Responsibility Changes
- Users must upload job descriptions to job upload endpoints
- Users must upload resumes to resume upload endpoints
- System no longer auto-classifies document types
- Keyword-based fallback detection still available

## Quality Assurance
- Maintained JSON response formats
- Preserved all essential data fields
- Added fallback mechanisms for extraction failures
- Kept detailed matching analysis for hiring decisions

## Next Steps for Further Optimization
1. Implement batch processing for multiple documents
2. Add intelligent caching for similar documents
3. Consider local preprocessing for common patterns
4. Monitor actual usage costs and adjust limits as needed
